## rdrop - Command-Line File Sharing Tool

A super-simple command-line utility for quickly sharing a single file over your local network.

### How to Use It

**To share a file:**

```bash
rdrop -i ./file.txt
```

**To specify a port (optional):**

```bash
rdrop -i ./file.txt -p 1130
```

Once running, `rdrop` will display the access links. Please note this is for **trusted local networks** only and doesn't offer security features.
